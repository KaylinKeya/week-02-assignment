Throughout this homework cycle I practiced how to write codes in various different programs. It was frustrating at first, but with some time messing around with the material, I was having fun with the excitement of getting things right. I made some different files on my own to mess around a little more with the programs and get familiarized.

-I read all of the material on our Web Development 'materials' online and took quite a few notes.
-I also spent a lot of time staring at the computer screen, dumbfounded.

Some of the problems and issues that I had:

1. Getting all of the programs connected to each other.
2. Figuring out how to send a repository from [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) to [GitHub](https://github.com/)

After some of my own research on the material provided in Moodle, I was able to finally figure it out. I did not use the Issues page to post my issues as I completely forgot that source was there, with everything else we are learning! Will use in the future.

I assisted some of my classmates in the connection of SourceTree to GitHub.
